## Introduction
Provide an overview of the report. Briefly explain the purpose, scope, and importance of Enterprise Integration in modern software architecture. 

## What is Enterprise Integration?
Define Enterprise Integration and discuss its significance in building scalable, distributed applications. Include key concepts and goals, such as interoperability, scalability, and flexibility.

## Architectural Styles
### Monolithic Architecture
Explain what Monolithic Architecture is, including its benefits and challenges. Provide examples of where it might still be relevant today.

### Microservices Architecture
Discuss the Microservices approach, focusing on its advantages over monolithic systems, such as scalability and independence of services. Include examples of industries or companies where Microservices are heavily used.

## Integration Patterns
### Pipes and Filters
- **Overview**: Describe the Pipes and Filters pattern. 
- **Diagram**: Insert a diagram illustrating how Pipes and Filters work.
- **Use Cases**: Explain where and why this pattern might be used.
  
### Message Broker
- **Overview**: Describe the Message Broker pattern.
- **Diagram**: Include a diagram to represent the Message Broker pattern.
- **Use Cases**: Provide scenarios where this pattern is applicable.

### Other Patterns
Briefly mention other common integration patterns, such as:
- **Publish-Subscribe**
- **Request-Reply**

## Diagramming Standards
### UML
- **Explanation**: Describe UML (Unified Modeling Language) and its relevance in Enterprise Integration.
- **Examples**: Provide a simple UML diagram relevant to your topic.

### Mermaid Diagrams
- **Explanation**: Explain how Mermaid can be used to create diagrams directly in Markdown.
- **Examples**: Include a Mermaid diagram example within the markdown using Mermaid syntax.

## Code Examples
### Pipes and Filters Implementation
- **Overview**: Explain the code provided.
- **Code Snippets**: Include the relevant code snippets.
- **Explanation**: Walk through the code, explaining key components and how they implement the pattern.

### Other Patterns Implementation
Follow the same format as above for any additional patterns you implement.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key points discussed in the report. Reinforce the importance of understanding and applying Enterprise Integration principles in real-world scenarios.
