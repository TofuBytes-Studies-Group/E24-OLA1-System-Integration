# OLA 2: Distributed Architecture – Modern Enterprise Architecture
 - Group: **TofuBytes**
 - Members: **Isak, Jamie & Helena**
## Objective
This assignment is focused on exploring the concepts of Enterprise and Solution Architecture as well as understanding the role of teams, integration patterns, and modern architectural practices. It also aims to provide a foundation for the exam project by allowing students to research relevant tools and technologies for building scalable, service-based enterprise applications.

## Overview
This assignment focuses on the different aspects of modern enterprise architecture, including comparisons between enterprise and solution architectures, the role of teams, architectural centralization, and key integration patterns. The answers to the questions will provide a deep understanding of how to build and scale enterprise systems in distributed environments.

## Study Materials
Before answering the questions, ensure you have gone through the following resources:
- Moodle videos on Enterprise Architecture
- PowerPoint slides on Enterprise Architecture and Integration Patterns
- Suggested readings: *Team Topologies* by Matthew Skelton, *Enterprise Integration Patterns* by Gregor Hohpe, and the article by Simon Rohrer on modern enterprise architecture.

## Assignment Questions

### Q1: Enterprise vs Solution Architecture
- **Objective**: Explain the differences between Enterprise Architecture and Solution Architecture.
  - Describe how these roles contribute to the design of large-scale systems.
  - Reference the video: *Enterprise Architecture vs Solution Architecture*.

### Q2: Role of Teams in Modern Architecture
- **Objective**: Discuss Stefan Tilkov's views on team roles in architecture.
  - Reference the video *Practical Architecture*.
  - Summarize how *Team Topologies* views team structures and whether you agree with the importance of teams in project success.

### Q3: Centralization in Architecture
- **Objective**: Explain the reasoning behind Stefan Tilkov’s argument for centralizing certain architectural decisions.
  - Focus on his claims around centralization benefits (starting at 23:30 in *Practical Architecture*).

### Q4: ABCDE of Modern Architecture
- **Objective**: Analyze Simon Rohrer’s ABCDE comparison of modern vs. legacy architectures.
  - Provide your opinion on whether his arguments for modern architecture are persuasive.

- A) **Aligning values, people, and technology.** This makes sense—if the whole team is aligned, it leads to better cooperation within the team and across areas of expertise, ensuring that all team members are on the same page.

- B) **Better, value, sooner, safer, happier.** "Better" means delivering the best possible quality of the product. In the video, he explains "value" as what makes you special. "Sooner" refers to learn faster and delivering value faster. "Safer" obviously refers to security and privacy. "Happier" means making everyone involved with the product happier, not just the customer, but also the employees and even the environment/climate.

- C) **Continuous Conversational Governance.** This is about having ongoing conversations about the architecture and involving every member in the discussion. This approach allows for a more agile design of the architecture.

- D) **DevOps at enterprise scale.** This refers to implementing DevOps on a large, enterprise-wide scale.

- E) **Evolutionary enterprise architecture.** This focuses on continuous improvement over time.

His arguments are persuasive, and even without having used them, they make a lot of sense. They focus heavily on community within the team and on CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment).

### Q5: Continuous Conversation and DevOps
- **Objective**: Summarize Simon Rohrer’s explanation of the “Continuous Conversation” and its benefits to Saxo Bank.
  - Explain its connection to the DevOps Infinity Loop.

### Q6: Messaging Integration Patterns
- **Objective**: Identify and describe five messaging integration patterns, including the *Pipes and Filters* and *Request-Reply* patterns.
  - Use the PowerPoint slides on integration patterns as your reference.
  - Provide real-world use cases and, optionally, code examples for these patterns.

### Q7: Messaging vs Conversation Architectures
- **Objective**: Discuss the difference between messaging and conversation architectures as explained by Gregor Hohpe.
  - Focus on challenges like pub-sub vs. subscribe-notify models (starting at 18 minutes in *Enterprise Integration Patterns 2*).

### Q8: Pattern Languages
- **Objective**: Summarize the core concepts of pattern languages as described by Gregor Hohpe.

  - For patterns to be truly useful, they need to be clear and understandable, allowing practitioners to easily grasp and communicate the ideas they represent. They must be proven solutions, drawn from real-world experiences, demonstrating their effectiveness in addressing recurring problems. It’s crucial that patterns are context-aware, clearly defining the situations where they are most applicable, so they are used appropriately. Additionally, useful patterns should document both their benefits and potential trade-offs, helping practitioners make informed decisions. Reusability is also key—patterns should be general enough to apply across different scenarios while still providing specific, actionable guidance. Finally, patterns are most effective when they are part of a larger pattern language, connecting with other patterns to provide a comprehensive roadmap for solving complex problems.

### Q9: Strangler Pattern
- **Objective**: Explain the *Strangler Pattern* as described in Simon Rohrer’s article.
  - Discuss why it is considered complex and how it helps in moving away from legacy systems.

### Q10: Core Architecture Diagrams
- **Objective**: List and explain the three core architecture diagrams described by Jesper Lowgren.
  - Provide examples of each diagram and explain their roles in solution architecture.


### Due Date:
- **Submission Deadline**: 16 September 2024
